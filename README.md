# robust-folding-paper-support
Notebooks and data for the paper "Robust folding of elastic origami".

These notebooks require the mechanisms package, located at https://github.com/cdsantan/mechanisms. If there are version incompatibilities email marvlee@umass.edu or cdsantan@syr.edu for an older version. 

Notebooks contents are as follows: energyLandscapes.nb contains the functions for creating the energy landscapes in Fig. 1 and shows how to create the ones seen in Fig. 1. bistabilityDiagrams.nb contains the functions and code for the bistability diagrams in Fig. 2. fineMeshBistabilityData contains the data for the bistability diagrams saved as a Mathematica object. randlettBirdPlot.nb contains the functions used to create and manipulate the Randlett birds for Fig. 4, as well as an example data run and the code for the plot. The remaining files are the Randlett bird data saved as Mathematica objects and are needed for randlettBirdPlot.nb
